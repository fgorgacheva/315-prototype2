**********************
**    HYPOTHESIS    **
**********************
When dropped in an environment without instructions, is the first instinct to explore out of curiosity or to find a purpose as quickly as possible?



**********************
**      DESIGN      **
**********************
Small forest scene with items laying around to signify purpose.



**********************
**  PLAYTEST NOTES  **
**********************
- everyone first walk around, looked at things
- runes look interactable, look like they serve some purpose but maybe not, players moved on quickly (could be interactable or not, both possible)
- find cube first > this looks pickable maybe it does something, pick up just in case. Sound indicates something happened, start looking for what happened
- find building first > look around for a way to open, explore more, maybe runes do something? when found cube, players knew exactly what happened



***************************
**    FOLLOW UP NOTES    **
***************************
It does seem like when first launched into the environment, the first insitinct is to look around. Exploring and finding purpose seem to go hand-in hand. They explore for a purpose or to find a purpose. So it's not like "i have a purpose let me find it" or "there's nothing to do here i'll just look around until I find something". 

It really looks like it's human nature to look for a purpose. Unless indicated otherwise, that an environement is really just made to look cool, then players will be looking for what to do or accomplish, solve a puzzle, find some items, unlock areas, etc.

Coulc be context as well. The human brain can understand context without being explained. For example, the Occulus home environment, it is not explained that it's not a game or not "explorable" but everyone understands this is just like a home we sit in and access the menu from. We instinctively look around, but do not look for a purpose because the context is assumed and understood implicitly.

In conclusion, games can often use "logic" and human nature to direct the flow of their games for intricate level designs in allowing players to figure things out rather than explaining every detail, in other words, spoon feeding the purpose to the players. There is entertainment in figuring some things out on your own. It's not to say that instructions can be entirely left out, I think for sucha design, they should be available if sought.



***************************
**  FUTURE OF THE GAME   **
***************************
The puzzle may be more complex, allow the runes to be interactable or serve a greater purpose. The sword implies that it may be used to defeat enemies, or could potentially be a key to a different puzzle (like the sword stuck in a rock story). Including a purpose for the newly unlocked item would make for a more intricate game.

I want the puzzles and items to be self explanatory as much as possible to see how far human intuition can take players through a game.
